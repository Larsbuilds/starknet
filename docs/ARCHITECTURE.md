# Starknet Foundation Contract Architecture

## Overview
The Starknet Foundation contract is designed with a focus on simplicity, security, and extensibility. This document outlines the technical architecture and design decisions.

## Contract Structure

### Storage
```cairo
#[storage]
struct Storage {
    starknet_foundation_api_key: felt252,
}
```
The contract uses a simple storage structure to maintain the API key. The key is stored as a felt252 type, which is Starknet's native field element type.

### Events
```cairo
#[event]
enum Event {
    ApiKeyUpdated: ApiKeyUpdated,
}

struct ApiKeyUpdated {
    old_key: felt252,
    new_key: felt252,
}
```
Events are emitted to track API key changes, providing transparency and auditability.

## Core Functions

### Constructor
```cairo
#[constructor]
fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, initial_api_key: felt252)
```
- Initializes the contract with an initial API key
- Can only be called once during contract deployment

### API Key Management
```cairo
#[external(v0)]
fn update_api_key(ref self: ContractState, new_api_key: felt252)
```
- Updates the stored API key
- Emits an ApiKeyUpdated event

```cairo
#[external(v0)]
fn get_api_key(self: @ContractState) -> felt252
```
- Retrieves the current API key

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Currently, any address can update the API key. Consider implementing role-based access control.
2. **Event Emission**: All key changes are logged via events for transparency.
3. **State Management**: Simple state management reduces attack surface.

## Future Improvements

1. Add role-based access control
2. Implement key rotation policies
3. Add emergency pause functionality
4. Implement multi-signature requirements for key updates

## Dependencies
- Starknet standard library (v2.3.0)
- Cairo 1.0 features

## Testing Architecture
The contract includes both unit and integration tests to ensure reliability:
- Unit tests for individual function behavior
- Integration tests for contract interactions
