# Security Considerations

## Overview
This document outlines the security considerations, best practices, and potential risks associated with the Starknet Foundation contract.

## Current Security Features

### Event Logging
- All API key changes are logged through events
- Provides audit trail for key modifications
- Enables monitoring for unauthorized changes

### Simple State Management
- Minimized state variables reduce attack surface
- Single storage slot for API key
- No complex state interactions that could lead to reentrancy

## Security Risks and Mitigations

### Access Control
#### Current Status
- No access control implementation
- Any address can modify the API key

#### Recommended Improvements
1. Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
2. Add owner/admin functionality
3. Implement multi-signature requirements for key updates

### Key Management
#### Risks
- API keys stored on-chain are visible to all
- No key rotation policy
- No emergency key revocation mechanism

#### Recommendations
1. Implement key hashing before storage
2. Add key rotation requirements
3. Implement emergency pause functionality
4. Add key expiration mechanism

### Front-Running Protection
#### Risks
- Key updates could be front-run
- Transaction ordering manipulation possible

#### Recommendations
1. Implement commit-reveal scheme for key updates
2. Add transaction deadlines
3. Consider using a private mempool

## Best Practices for Users

### Contract Interaction
1. Always verify transaction success
2. Monitor ApiKeyUpdated events
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Use secure RPC endpoints

### Key Management
1. Never expose API keys in public transactions
2. Rotate keys regularly
3. Use strong key generation practices
4. Maintain secure key backup procedures

## Audit Status

### Current Status
- Internal review completed
- External audit pending

### Audit Recommendations
1. Complete external security audit
2. Implement fuzzing tests
3. Add invariant testing
4. Conduct formal verification

## Emergency Procedures

### Current Capabilities
- No emergency pause functionality
- No key recovery mechanism

### Recommended Additions
1. Emergency pause function
2. Time-locked recovery
3. Multi-signature recovery process
4. Incident response plan

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. Role-based access control
2. Key rotation policy
3. Emergency pause functionality
4. Multi-signature requirements
5. Timelock for sensitive operations

### Long-term Considerations
1. Upgrade mechanism for security patches
2. Integration with security monitoring tools
3. Automated security testing
4. Regular security assessments
