# StarkNet Foundation Deployment Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the staged deployment process for the StarkNet Foundation template. The deployment follows a phased approach to ensure stability, security, and proper testing at each stage.

## Deployment Stages

### 1. Testnet (Development)
- **Network**: Alpha Goerli
- **Purpose**: Initial development and testing
- **Features**:
  - Basic contract functionality
  - Event indexing
  - Health monitoring
- **User Limit**: None (development only)
- **Prerequisites**:
  ```bash
  # .env configuration
  DEPLOYMENT_STAGE=testnet
  STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli
  ```

### 2. Testnet Production
- **Network**: Alpha Goerli
- **Purpose**: Testing with real users
- **Features**:
  - All testnet features
  - User authentication
- **User Limit**: 100 users
- **Prerequisites**:
  ```bash
  # .env configuration
  DEPLOYMENT_STAGE=testnet_prod
  STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli
  INITIAL_API_KEY=your_api_key
  ```

### 3. Mainnet Limited
- **Network**: Alpha Mainnet
- **Purpose**: Controlled mainnet deployment
- **Features**:
  - All testnet production features
  - Enhanced security measures
- **User Limit**: 1000 users
- **Prerequisites**:
  ```bash
  # .env configuration
  DEPLOYMENT_STAGE=mainnet_limited
  STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-mainnet
  INITIAL_API_KEY=your_api_key
  ```

### 4. Mainnet Full
- **Network**: Alpha Mainnet
- **Purpose**: Full production deployment
- **Features**:
  - All features enabled
  - No user limits
  - Full production monitoring
- **Prerequisites**:
  ```bash
  # .env configuration
  DEPLOYMENT_STAGE=mainnet_full
  STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-mainnet
  INITIAL_API_KEY=your_api_key
  ```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Verify environment variables in `.env`
- [ ] Ensure sufficient funds in deployment account
- [ ] Backup current contract state (if upgrading)
- [ ] Review contract code changes
- [ ] Run test suite

### 2. Deployment Steps
1. Set deployment stage in `.env`
2. Run deployment script:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
3. Verify deployment on StarkScan
4. Update `.env` with new contract address
5. Start monitoring services:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### 3. Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Verify contract deployment on StarkScan
- [ ] Check health monitoring status
- [ ] Verify event indexing
- [ ] Test contract functions
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

## Contract Functions by Stage

### Testnet
- `update_api_key`
- `get_api_key`
- Basic event tracking

### Testnet Production
- All testnet functions
- `add_user`
- `remove_user`
- `is_user_allowed`
- User authentication

### Mainnet Limited
- All testnet production functions
- `update_user_limit`
- Enhanced security checks
- User limit enforcement

### Mainnet Full
- All functions enabled
- No user limits
- Full feature set

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
- Run health checks:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/health
  ```
- Monitor event indexing
- Track user limits
- Watch for contract events

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor contract performance
- Check user limits
- Review event logs
- Update API keys as needed
- Monitor network status

## Rollback Procedures

### Testnet Rollback
1. Stop current deployment
2. Deploy previous version
3. Update contract address
4. Restart services

### Mainnet Rollback
1. Emergency stop current deployment
2. Deploy previous version
3. Update contract address
4. Notify users
5. Restart services

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Owner-only functions
- User limits per stage
- API key management
- Event tracking

### Monitoring
- Health checks
- Event indexing
- User activity
- Contract state
